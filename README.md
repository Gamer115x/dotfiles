# dotfiles
Personal Dotfiles and configuration folders for software.

**Do not copy/paste these in your own directories unless you know what you're doing.**

As a general rule, these files are meant for one singular purpose: historical documentation and debugging.
No I don't care that it's separated by the word "and", this is my repository and I'll document it how I please.

It may be required that these files be asked for with the intention of support or for example of certain submodules.

*These were built on Manjaro 5.6.12+ (As per `uname -r` at the time of commit). It is possible they can contain mention of AUR packages. Keep this in mind in case something calls on a package that doesn't exist in a Package Manager.*
